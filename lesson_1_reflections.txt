How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u game_old.js game_new.js
	Shows the difference between versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    -maybe the old version was better
    -it can help to find typos

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: can commit logical changes
    con: maybe forget to commit and then changes are too big

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    multipl: if the logic change has been made in more than one file
    separat: if the files are not logically connected

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: shows all commits in the directory
    git diff old.file new.file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git checkout the-old-version: to find where the mistake was made

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    latex?
